# Machine-Learning-Notes

Hi,

My name is Kent. Currently I am a Mechanical Engineer who graduated from University of Manchester and working professionally as a Mechanical Design Engineer in the Nuclear industry. So far I have 3 years of professional experience, having worked in Wasterwater and Nuclear Decomissioning Industry. My mission is to upskill myself in the world of Machine Learning and Robotics to combine with my Mechanical expertise. I have set out to journal my progress on GitHub for others to view. I am more than happy to collaborate with others, so please do not hesistate to reach out to me. :)
